Skills Passport is part of SkillsFuture Singapore’s MySkillsFuture website. It is a depository of individual’s records of skills, certificates, licences and other achievement records. Individuals will have the discretion to select the relevant records that you wish to share with potential employers via the Share Skills Passport function.

We are currently working on a consent-based API that will allow your institution to upload OpenCerts onto SkillsPassport, more details will be shared when ready.
